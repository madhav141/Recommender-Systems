# Recommender-Systems

Till recently, people generally tended to buy products recommended to them by their friends or the people they trust. This used to be the primary method of purchase when there was any doubt about the product. But with the advent of the digital age, that circle has expanded to include online sites that utilize some sort of recommendation engine.

A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy.

In this project, I will work on the MovieLens dataset and build a model to recommend movies to the end users. This data has been collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. The dataset can be downloaded from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/. 

This dataset consists of:

- 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies
- Demographic information of the users (age, gender, occupation, etc.)
